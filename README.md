# Question Game for Rhythm

This is my very first full-stack web project. It's a simple experimental multiplayer question game developed as a concept prototype for the Rhythm project.

The goal was to learn the basics of building interactive real-time applications using:

- **React** for the frontend
- **Node.js** + **Express** for the backend
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication

Players join a lobby, enter their names, and vote on questions in real time. Once everyone has voted (or time runs out), results are displayed and the game progresses to the next level.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io
